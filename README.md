# C# Microservices Development on Azure [Video]
This is the code repository for [C# Microservices Development on 

Azure [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-

cloud/c-microservices-development-azure-video), published by

all the supporting project files necessary to work through the 

video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Microservices bring new challenges that weren’t present in simpler 

architectures. This course will teach you how to handle all those 

challenges and overcome various obstacles including services 

communication and state management.
Scaling monolithic applications can be expensive or even 

impossible. In this course, you’ll learn to break down monoliths 

into smaller microservices written in C# and .NET Core. You’ll 

easily develop, deploy, maintain, and scale them into clusters 

without worrying about low-level configuration with the help of 

Visual Studio and Azure Service Fabric.
By the end of this course, you’ll be able to develop web 

applications with C# and .NET Core, easily maintain them at a lower 

cost, and deploy them as highly-scalable microservices using Azure 

Service Fabric.
